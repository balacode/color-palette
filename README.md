This is a page to quickly find colors by name or color code. 
When the page loads, doesn't show any color.

When you enter a name, searches for the closest matching color names.

When you enter a code starting with #, searches for
a HTML color code and the similar-looking colors.

There are more than 16,000 colors in the list, thanks to @meodai's project.

## Acknowledgement
This page uses the list of color names from:

If you want to add a new color, please add it there.
